## Usage


To use the website, simply navigate to the page URL (https://zaccahimba.github.io/GoodCoffeeBeans/index.html). Once there, you can find the “Add Coffee” and “Add Recipe” buttons in the navbar. Simply click the button, enter your information, and save to add either a coffee or a recipe to the list of cards. Also in the navbar are tabs to navigate to the “Flavor of the Day” section of the main site, to navigate to the “My Coffees” page where you can see cards that contain your saved coffees, and to navigate to the “My Recipes” page, where you can see cards containing your saved coffee recipes as well as a button to delete them if desired. Lastly, the navbar contains the “Find a Coffee Shop” tab which directs you to a Google Maps search of coffee shops in your area.

On the main page, under the navbar, is displayed a coffee suggestion and its corresponding picture to provide motivation to try something new! Refreshing the page changes this suggestion.

Navigating to second page by clicking either “My Coffees” or “My Recipes” in the navbar, you’ll see a list of the coffees or recipes you have added. The cards containing the coffee information have a button to allow you to save a recipe which corresponds to that coffee. It is not linked to that coffee, however, so the recipe can be for any brew you’d like. In the “Recipes” section, cards containing the recipes are displayed along with a number in front of the title you chose. This number is used to delete a recipe. To do this, select the “Delete a Recipe” button under the “Recipes” heading, add the number of the recipe you want to delete, and then confirm that you’d like to delete that recipe.

Important to note, the website uses local browser storage, so coffee or recipe information added from different browsers or devices will save to that browser or device alone. 

The website is responsive. Try it on your smartphone!
